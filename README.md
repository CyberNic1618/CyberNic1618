- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,
Iâ€™m @CyberNic1618 and am an Outsourced Accountant that does a bit of program and data analysis and a bunch of automation. I mainly work with accounting software, Excel, VBA, SQL, PowerBI and a bit of Python.
Im looking to shift my career into IT Assurance and Cybersecurity. Iâ€™m currently learning SQL more indepth through DataCamp and studying for my A+, Network+ and Security+
- ðŸ‘¯ I'd love to connect and collaborate on SQL, VBA, Python and C++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge Warhammer 40k fan and love motorcycles and cars
